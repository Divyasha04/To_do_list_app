# ✅ To-Do List App (Python)

A simple command-line to-do list application built using Python. This app lets you **add**, **view**, and **remove tasks**, and automatically saves your tasks to a file (`tasks.txt`) so you don’t lose them when you close the program.

---

## 🚀 Features

- View your current list of tasks 📋  
- Add new tasks ➕  
- Remove completed or unwanted tasks ❌  
- Automatically saves your tasks to a file 💾

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Tasks are stored in a list** during program runtime.
2. **`tasks.txt`** is used to save and load tasks between runs.
3. The menu shows 4 options:
   - `1`: View tasks
   - `2`: Add a new task
   - `3`: Remove a task
   - `4`: Save and Exit
